## Archivement 

* Setup a mathematical model of robot and successfully simulate the model on Matlab Simulink

* Complete design self-balancing two wheel robot model

* The model can keep its balance in place


## Further Development 

* Develop a better PID control system for each wheel
* Design moving function for the robot
